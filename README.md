# Bring Plant-Based Dining to Franklin 
What drives vegetarian/vegan restaurants to open in certain areas? Do any of these factors play a roll? Education, age/size of population, culture, wealth, other businesses (aka yoga studios, health stores, etc.) 

## Motivation
I have been a vegetarian for 13 years and also have a severe dairy allergy. (I think at least briefly pointing out allergens would be beneficial in a business plan.) While I love living in Franklin, TN, there are no vegetarian/vegan specific restaurants here. I have always been an avid traveler, but since March of this year, I am unable to visit veggie friendly cities. I want to look into the areas with high numbers of these restaurants and find out what it would take for one (or more) to open in my own neighborhood.
